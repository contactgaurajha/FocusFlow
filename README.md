## A smart To-Do list catered towards students

**Our Goals:**
1. Create a to-do list that sorts tasks by priority & date
2. Send reminders to finish tasks
3. Keep the user's to-do list synced across other Apple devices 
4. Integrate with Apple Calendar to save time for students
   - Create and add tasks in FocusFlow
   - Automatically adds to the user's Apple Calendar
   - When tasks are marked as completed in FocusFlow, they are automatically deleted from Calendar
